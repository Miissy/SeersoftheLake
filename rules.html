        <h1>Seers of the Lake</h1>
        <p><b>Conduct:</b> Most important rule, be kind, welcoming, considerate. Do not be passive aggressive, rude, or
            salty.
            This is a safe place. We will not tolerate bullying of any kind regardless of Free Company rank, length of
            service or position. In an event where we feel this rule has been broken, a member will be muted and taken
            to a private room for discussions; where a warning or ban may be applied.</p>
        <p><b>Discrimination:</b> This server has a ZERO tolerance to discrimination across all settings. This means, NO
            racial, sexual or gender discrimination. We are proud of our stance on being kind and respectful to all.
            Anyone not fitting to this principle of being respectful to another persons culture or choices of sexuality
            are not welcome here.</p>
        <p><b>Beginner-friendly Policy:</b> We offer aid to beginners and we do not judge others according to their game
            preferences. If you're in need of help or advice regarding gameplay, we're here to help when we're able to.
            We want to create a safe environment for people who are curious and willing to learn. We do NOT tolerate any
            form of elitism - we all play this game for fun and toxicity has no place here.</p>
        <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> The leadership team reserve the right to remove/ban/mute users without warning or notice
            or when
            the user is found to be purposely trying to push leaders boundaries or test our limits. Disrespecting us or
            our rules, or consistently "walking the line" for your own amusement will not be tolerated</p>
        <p><b>NSFW Content</b> The Seers of the Lake Discord does not have an NSFW channel, and as this is a community
            with a broad variety of ages and sensibilities we ask that everyone respects the wishes of others by keeping
            NSFW content out of this discord; there are plenty of other communities where one can indulge in this aspect
            of social interaction but we are committed to keeping this community safe and inclusive for all. Keep NSFW
            chat and pictures private please.</p>
